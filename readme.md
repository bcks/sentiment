## Usage

Run consume.js to consume Tweets, analyze them  and save them to Twitter.

Run app.js to visualize Tweets.

I like (pm2)[https://github.com/Unitech/pm2] to keep node apps running.


## Warning

This demo should help you started. Do not run this *as is* on a public server. Passing URL parameters directly to your database is bad.
